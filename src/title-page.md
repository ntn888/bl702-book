# BL702: A Programmers' Manual

We tackle the bl-iot-sdk programming environment in this book from the perspective of the part BL702 from Bouffalo Lab. We'll have a good look at it's peripheral API implementation, moving through to writing device drivers within this environment. A study of the freeRTOS is also included, since this is the default kernel in the SDK.

The order of flow will be as follows:

- Environment Setup
- Kernel API: freeRTOS
- Peripherals API
- Device Drivers
