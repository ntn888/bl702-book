# Introduction

The BL702 is a new offering from the chip design company Bouffalo Lab, that is extremely cheap, performant RISC-V chip. With all the bells & whistles of IoT, it’s got BLE, 802.15.4, and Zigbee. The BL702C MCU specs at: 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller @ 144 MHz with FPU, 132KB RAM, 192KB ROM, and the breakout board has an 8MB embedded flash. That’s decent enough for most of demanding applications.

## Prerequisites

A host computer, preferably running a recent edition of Linux. You should have a good grasp of the C language. Previous knowledege in embedded development (MCUs, reading datasheets, protocols, etc) is certainly helpful.
